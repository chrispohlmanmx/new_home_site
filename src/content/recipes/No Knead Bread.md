*bread, baking, easy*

**1 large boule**

---

- 4 cups AP flour

- 2 cups water 70 degrees F

1. Combine the flour, yeast, salt in a large bowl. Add water and stir until you have a shaggy sticky dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for about 18 hours. The dough is ready when the surface is dotted with bubbles
2. Lightly flour a work surface, remove the dough and fold once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for about 15 minutes
3. Shape the dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel with cornmeal and put the dough seam side down on the towel. Cover with another cotton towel or plastic wrap and let rise for 2 hours. 
4. At least 30 minutes before the dough is ready, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and place a dutch oven inside during heating.
5. When the dough is ready place it in the dutch oven and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and bake for an additional 20-30 minutes.
6. Remove the dough and let rest on a wire rack before slicing
