# Re-writing this website in Astro
Recently I released a new version of my personal portfolio site at https://chrispohlman.com. The old one was something I had put together quite quickly and extremely early on in my software development career. Like prior to my first internship early. Now that I've been working professionally as a web developer for about a year I felt like it was a good time for a refresh. Now this new version is by no means perfect or even really in a state that I feelis 100% complete, but it is fully functional and at a point where I feel fine sharing it with the 3.5 people who are ever really likely to stumble across it. At the very least I feel quite confident that it is an improvement over my previous iteration and ultimately that is what is most important. 
## What was it before?
So what was this site like before? It was an extremely basic react app with a landing page that had two, 'cards' we will call them, that acted as links to a couple of my personal projects. 

## Why Astro?
